## 📂 Capstone Project: Event-Tracking App

This project was enhanced to showcase my **skills in software engineering, algorithms, and databases**.

### 🔹 Original Project
The app allows users to **create, manage, and receive notifications** for events. Initially, it lacked optimization for handling data efficiently.

### 🔹 Enhancements  
- ✅ **Software Engineering:** Improved UI with **swipe actions** for editing/deleting events.  
- ✅ **Algorithms & Data Structures:** Optimized **event sorting and filtering** to prevent unnecessary database reloads.  
- ✅ **Databases:** Migrated from **raw SQLite** to **Room Database** for better security and data handling.
